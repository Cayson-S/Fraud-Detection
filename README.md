# Fraud_Detection

This project looks to classify transaction data as fraudulent.

## Background

<p>&emsp;Monetary transactions are frequent occurrences as customers purchase products and services. While this behavior is normal, bad actors 
can subvert this process by making fraudulent transactions. To minimize the damage done by these individuals and groups, mobile money services must be proactive in flagging 
transactions that are likely fraudulent. Unfortunately, fraudulent transactions can be almost indistinguishable from legitimate ones. They can also occur at any time. This 
combination of factors makes transactions near impossible for humans to speedily analyze for fraud. Thus, to protect their customers, mobile money services must invest in a 
data science solution that uses statistical analyses to accurately identify and block transactions that have a high degree of probability of being fraudulent.</p>
